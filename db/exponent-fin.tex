\item In New York State, the minimum wage has grown exponentially. In 1966, the minimum wage was $\$1.25$ an hour and in 2015, it was $\$8.75$. Algebraically determine the rate of growth to the nearest percent.
\item Jim is looking to buy a vacation home for $\$172,600$ near his favorite southern beach. The formula to compute a mortgage payment, $M$, is $M=P \times \frac{r(1+r)^N}{(1+r)^N -1}$ where $P$ is the principal amount of the loan, $r$ is the monthly interest rate, and $N$ is the number of monthly payments. Jim's bank offers monthly interest rate of 0.305\% for a 15-year loan.\\*(a) With no down payment, determine Jim's mortgage payment, rounded to the nearest dollar.\\*(b) Algebraically determine and state the down payment, rounded to the nearest dollar, that Jim needs to make in order for his mortgage payment to be $\$1100$
