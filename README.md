This is a project to assist mathematics teachers assign appropriate practice exercises to students and monitor their progress. It is in the initial stages, building a few modules to learn LaTeX, Python, Git, and related tools. The first practical achievement is a worksheet generator with a couple configuration files and a small database of problems, also stored as text files.

The primary program files are main.py, makedoc.py, and loadbank.py

Directories:
  src - python programs
  db - persistent stores of problems, worksheets, and skills
  out - worksheets produced by the program, LaTeX and pdf versions
  in - data to be input in various formats (csv, Excel, txt), eg. new problems or skills lists
