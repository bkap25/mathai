This is a project to assist mathematics teachers assign appropriate practice exercises to students and monitor their progress. It is in the initial stages, building a few modules to learn LaTeX, Python, Git, and related tools. The first practical achievement is a worksheet generator with a couple configuration files and a small database of problems, also stored as text files. 

The primary program files are main.py, makedoc.py, and loadbank.py
