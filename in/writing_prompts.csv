Explain and justify why exponents should be added when terms with the same base are multiplied (subtracted/divided).
Demonstrate the distributive property of multiplication over addition by restating multiplication as repeated addition.
Explain why exponential functions with bases less than one are decreasing (decay), and how that relates to having a negative coefficient in the exponent
Explain why adding a positive value to x before applying a function moves the curve horizontally to the left, while adding a positive value to the function output (the y) moves the curve vertically upward.
Explain why multiplying the input of a function by a negative (x's coefficient) reflects the curve horizontally across the y-axis, while whereas taking the inverse of the function output  (negative  applied to the y) flips the curve vertically across the x-axis.
Why is the function f(x)=abs(x) symmetric across the y-axis?
Why does a polynomial function composed only of even powers of x look the same when the x inputs are multiplied by negative one? (i.e. it is invariant, that is f(-x)=f(x))
How would you explain at middle school level that addition and subtraction can be thought of as walking on a number line. Use walking to the right as addition and to the left subtraction. Step backward for negative numbers. Include examples.
If positive three is a zero of a polynomial function, why is a factor $(x-3)$? Explain why the sign changes. Use the term additive inverse.
When we "complete the square," why do we make a note $(-\frac{b}{2a})^2$ after the first step?

Why are errors sometimes essential to progress? Give an example and explain.
