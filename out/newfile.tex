\begin{enumerate}
\subsection*{Financial models with exponential growth}
\item In New York State, the minimum wage has grown exponentially. In 1966, the minimum wage was $\$1.25$ an hour and in 2015, it was $\$8.75$. Algebraically determine the rate of growth to the nearest percent.
\item Jim is looking to buy a vacation home for $\$172,600$ near his favorite southern beach. The formula to compute a mortgage payment, $M$, is $M=P \times \frac{r(1+r)^N}{(1+r)^N -1}$ where $P$ is the principal amount of the loan, $r$ is the monthly interest rate, and $N$ is the number of monthly payments. Jim's bank offers monthly interest rate of 0.305\% for a 15-year loan.\\*(a) With no down payment, determine Jim's mortgage payment, rounded to the nearest dollar.\\*(b) Algebraically determine and state the down payment, rounded to the nearest dollar, that Jim needs to make in order for his mortgage payment to be $\$1100$
\subsection*{Exponent problems}
\item $\sqrt[3]{x^{-9} y^{6}}$
\item $\displaystyle \left( x y^{\frac{1}{4}}\right)^2$
\subsection*{Logarithms}
\item $\log_6 4 + \log_6 9$
\item $\log 200 - \log 2$
\subsection*{Function inverse}
\item Given $f(x)=x^2+4$ find $f^{-1}(x)$
\item Given $g(x)=x^2-3$ find $g^{-1}(x)$
\subsection*{Substitute to find each answer}
\item Given $f(x) = x^2+3$ find $f(3)$
\end{enumerate}
